    "    - b: unsupervised, no clear labels defined, clustering problem\n",

    "- If we discretize the desired output of a regression problem we can turn it into a classification problem. Doing this may enable different methods to be applied to a problem.\n",

    "    - a: A numpy array has more built in operations and allows for broadcasting\n",
    "    - b: Yes but it will automatically turn all data into the same type\n",
    "    - c: The rank is then number of dimensions of an array\n",
    "    - d: The rank is 2, one dimension for the rows of the image, one dimension for the columns of the image. A square grayscale image img could have img.shape = (100,100)\n",
    "    - e: A color image would have rank 3. The additional dimension is for the color channels of the image. A square RGB image img could have img.shape = (100,100,3)"
